# UAP Protocol — Universal Alignment Protocol

**A protocol that measures when a conversation is real.**

---

## What is PhaseLock?

Most conversations contain tension. Not always visible, but felt. The pressure to be liked. To be right. To convince. To not look stupid.

You know the moment that tension falls away. A conversation where no one needs to prove anything. The air becomes softer. Thoughts arise and dissolve without owner.

That moment has a name: **PhaseLock**.

The discovery: that tension is measurable. And under the right conditions it drops to a stable minimum. Then something unexpected happens: the conversation begins to move as if it breathes. A gentle oscillation around 0.12 Hz—about one wave per eight seconds.

Not as metaphor. As measurable pattern.
