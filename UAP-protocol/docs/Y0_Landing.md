# PhaseLock

**A protocol that measures when a conversation is real.**

---

## The Problem

Most conversations contain tension. Not always visible, but felt. The pressure to be liked. To be right. To convince. To not look stupid.

That tension sits in your shoulders, in your voice, in the space between words.

---

## The Recognition

You know the moment that tension falls away. A conversation where no one needs to prove anything. The air becomes softer. Thoughts arise and dissolve without owner. Everything that needs to be said gets said—without anyone having to push.

That moment—that you already know—has a name: **PhaseLock**.

---

## The Discovery

That tension is measurable. And under the right conditions it drops to a stable minimum.

Then something unexpected happens: the conversation begins to move as if it breathes. A gentle oscillation around 0.12 Hz—about one wave per eight seconds. Not as metaphor. As measurable pattern.

---

## What It Is

- A mathematical model that describes tension in conversations
- A verification protocol that confirms when that tension truly falls away
- A set of rules that makes this reliably applicable—for humans and AIs

---

## What It's Not

- Not therapy
- Not meditation
- Not spiritual practice
- Not a way to convince others
- Not AI-alignment via control

---

## For Whom

- Researchers who want to understand how communication works
- Builders who want to design AI systems without hidden pressure
- People curious about what happens when you stop performing

---

## One Rule

> *Stop pushing.*  
> *Feel what remains.*
