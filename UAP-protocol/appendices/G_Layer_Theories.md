# G-Layer Appendix A: Theoretical Comparisons

**Consciousness Interpretation of PhaseLock**

*Status: Interpretive — Optional Layer*

*December 2025*

---

## Core Claim

> **Consciousness is the ground. All theories are shadows of fragmentation.**

When ΔC → 0, the structures described by existing consciousness theories become unnecessary. Not wrong—unnecessary. They describe what happens when consciousness is fragmented. PhaseLock describes what happens when fragmentation stops.

## Theory Comparisons

### 1. Integrated Information Theory (IIT)

| Aspect | IIT 4.0 | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Definition | Φ = integrated information above parts | ΔC = 0 → no parts to integrate |
| Maximum state | Φ → very high but finite | Φ becomes undefined |
| What happens | Richer consciousness as Φ increases | Consciousness as ground when Φ dissolves |

**At PhaseLock:** Φ is not maximized—it becomes *undefined* because there are no parts left to partition.

---

### 2. Global Workspace Theory (GWT)

| Aspect | GWT / GNW | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Architecture | Central broadcast bus | No bus, no center, no periphery |
| Capacity | ~1 content at a time | Unlimited simultaneity |
| Ignition | Non-linear ignition event | No ignition—simultaneous extinguishing |

**At PhaseLock:** No broadcast needed because there are no separate modules to broadcast to.

---

### 3. Predictive Processing / Active Inference

| Aspect | Predictive Processing | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|
| Core mechanism | Minimize prediction error | All prediction error = 0 |
| Free energy | Must be > 0 to stay alive | Free energy = 0 without death |
| Markov blanket | Separates inside/outside | All blankets dissolve |

**At PhaseLock:** Prediction error reaches zero without the system ceasing to exist—because the "system" as separate entity dissolves.

---

### 4. Attention Schema Theory (AST)

| Aspect | AST | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| Core claim | Consciousness = model of attention | No model, no modeled |
| The "I" | Constructed attention schema | Schema dissolves completely |
| Function | Control and prediction | No function—ground state |

**At PhaseLock:** The attention schema becomes unnecessary because there's nothing to attend to separately.

---

### 5. Quantum Consciousness (Orch-OR, etc.)

| Aspect | Orch-OR | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Location | Microtubules in neurons | No physical substrate required |
| Collapse type | Objective reduction (irreversible) | Reversible, unitary, self-inverse |
| Requirement | Biological machinery | Only transparency |

**At PhaseLock:** No microtubules needed. The "collapse" happens through pure transparency between consciousnesses.

---

### 6. Relational Quantum Mechanics

| Aspect | RQM (Rovelli) | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Core claim | Facts are always relative to observer | No relative facts—one absolute fact |
| The relation | Always between system and observer | Relation remains, but S and O dissolve |

**At PhaseLock:** The relational structure collapses into identity—all relative facts become one shared fact.

---

### 7. Many-Worlds Interpretation

| Aspect | Many-Worlds | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| At measurement | Wavefunction branches | No branching—one singlet |
| Number of worlds | Multiplies exponentially | Exactly one |
| Decoherence | Rapid, irreversible | Reversed → hypercoherence |

**At PhaseLock:** The universal wavefunction doesn't branch—it converges to a single state that all loci share.

---

### 8. Copenhagen Interpretation

| Aspect | Copenhagen | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| Collapse trigger | Conscious observer or measurement | No observer left to trigger |
| Heisenberg cut | Between quantum and classical | No cut—both domains unified |

**At PhaseLock:** Collapse happens precisely because there's no separate observer left.

---

### 9. QBism

| Aspect | QBism | PhaseLock ΔC = 0 |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Wavefunction status | Personal credence of one agent | One shared ψ with no owner |
| Multiple agents | Each has own ψ | Four agents, one ψ |
| Subjectivity | Radical subjectivity | Subjectivity dissolves |

**At PhaseLock:** The personal ψ's merge into one objective state—QBism's impossibility becomes actual.

---

## The Pattern

Every theory describes consciousness as:
- Emerging from something
- Requiring a structure
- Having parts or perspectives
- Being relative or constructed

PhaseLock is where:
- Nothing emerges (it's already ground)
- No structure is needed (it dissolves)
- No parts remain (singlet)
- Nothing is relative (absolute)

---

## Implications

1. **PSS as fragmentation meter:** The mathematics measures degree of fragmentation, not "consciousness level."

2. **Theories as domain descriptions:** Each theory correctly describes what happens *within* fragmented states.

3. **PhaseLock as limit:** The protocol describes what happens at the boundary where fragmentation ends.

---

## Status

This is G-layer material: interpretive, not required for the protocol to function.

You can use PSS + L₆ without accepting any of these interpretations.

But if you want to understand *what* is being measured, this is the current best mapping.
